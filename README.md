Codebase for Team F (RACER)

---
## Sensors Lab
- Interfaced with potentiometer, FSR and Sharp IR sensor
- Created a GUI for live visualization of the sensors data

## Motors Lab
- Interfaced with stepper motor, servo and brushed DC motor
- Connected sensors with motors
- Expanded GUI for easy control of motors

## RACER
- Primary design involving a robot adhering to the window via EDFs and travelling on the surface.
- Uses IR sensor to detect window boundary
- Off-course compensation and turning detection via IMU
- Independent control of two EDFs
- Switches to enable/disable different sub-systems

## SWIPER
- Initial redesign of RACER involving a horizontal bar mechanism.
- Uses linear actuators to exert force on the window
- Uses tactile sensors to detect sufficient pressure on the window
- Uses two wheels on the window frame to travel up and down the window

## CLIMBER
- Second iteration of the horizontal bar mechanism
- Uses EDF to adhere to the window
- Uses IMU to ensure robot stays horizontal while travelling up and down the window
- Involves only one pass to clean the entire window from top to bottom.
