                <h1>Problem Description</h1>
                <span class="border"></span>
                <p>In 2011, 8 workers in the United States sustained fatal injuries whilst cleaning the exterior of buildings. These cleaners suspend themselves midair and work with soapy water, putting themselves at a high risk of falling. Hence, this project serves to minimize the number of injuries and fatalities of window cleaning by automating the process, eliminating the need for workers to put themselves at risk.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Aptly named <em>RACER</em>, this robot is fully automated. By placing the robot in a predefined location on the window, it will automatically sense the dimensions of the window and perform the cleaning without any human inputs. In addition, our robot aims to be faster than other available robotic window cleaners out in the commercial market.</p>

                <h1>System Requirements</h1>
                <span class="border"></span>
                <h3>Explicit Design Requirements</h3><br/>
                <p>From the project specifications, there are several explicit requirements the robot has to meet. With regards to performance, the robot should fully clean one side of a window automatically, where the window size can range from 3' x 4' to 5' x 6'. More specifically, the robot must clean the entire surface of the window at a speed of at least 10 ft2 per min. In terms of cleanliness, the window will be visibly clean from a distance of 3 feet away with no streaks, moisture or residue left on the window after 30 seconds of completion. The robot should also be able to clean both glass and acrylic plastics without scratching or damaging the window surface.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>The robot's physical structure should fit within a 2 ft2 footprint. However, the robot can have retractable parts and a variable aspect ratio as long as the robot maintains the aforementioned 2 ft2 footprint. The cleaning devices should not cross the vertical plane of the window - this space would generally not be available due to protrusions around the window border. Cleaning supplies should also be contained within the robot. There should not be any infrastructure installed external to the robot with the exception of tethers connecting it to an external compressor and/or power. In addition, the robot should not be operated from the ground.</p>
                <br/><br/>
                <h3>Derived and Additional "Coolness" Factors</h3><br/>
                <p>Additional factors are included into our robot to stand out from the designs from other teams. We have chosen to increase the speed of the robot by 50% (cleaning at least 15 ft2 per min) while maintaining the high cleanliness standards required. Also, the robot is also designed to minimize the use of cleaning supplies (water and cleaning solution) in order to reduce its weight.</p>

                <span class="border"></span>
                <p>From the design requirements, our team derived four main functions the robot must have – movement, suction, environment-sensing and cleaning. Figure 1 depicts the major functions and flows between the functions.</p>

                <p>The sensors will be in-charged of providing the environmental information (such as cleanliness of window and position of the robot) to the controller. With the information, the controller then further instructs the locomotion subsystem. Figure 2 shows the logic flow of the robot's movement. In the meantime, the controller will separately instruct the cleaning component(s).</p><br/>

                <span class="border"></span>
                <p>The following architecture describes the flow of information between the different subsystems within our robot. As described previously, the following four main subsystems in the robot’s physical architecture (main controller, sensors, cleaning, and locomotion) are depicted in Figure 3 below. The supply of power will be distributed by the main controller (an Arduino Mega) to the other subsystems.</p>

                    <h4>Sensor</h4>
                    <p>The sensors component exists to interpret information from the current environment as well as the orientation of the robot. In this subsystem, there are two main components - grip sensors and boundary detection sensors. The grip sensors consist of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to sense the direction that the robot is facing with respect to gravity. The controller will make use of this information to calculate the required gripping force. The boundary detection component serves as the "eyes" of the robot. The IR sensors will provide feedback on the immediate surroundings of the robot, such as the distance to the nearest window boundary or obstacle.</p>

            <div class="one_half last">
                <div class="service-item text-left element_from_right">
                    <h4>Locomotion</h4>
                    <p>The locomotion subsystem consists of the robot’s movement and the adhesive grip on the window surface. Based on the information (direction, speed of travel, and fan speed) the controller subsystem provides, the locomotion subsystem carries out the movement direction by the controller. Our robot’s ability to move will be enabled by two independent wheels driven by motors. With independent movement for each of the wheels, the robot will have the additional flexibility to turn in place.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Our robot will employ an electric ducted fan as the adhesive component. The EDF creates a constant vacuum force onto the window, hence allowing the robot to be held in place on the window. An advantage of using the EDF would include the ability to manipulate the fan speed (and hence, the adhesive force) based on feedback from the sensors (FSR and IMU).</p>

                <div class="service-item text-right element_from_left">
                    <h4>Cleaning</h4>
                    <p>The cleaning subsystem has two main mechanisms – cloth extension and solution dispensing. The cloth extension uses microcloth to wipe and clean the surface. Hence, the cloth extension component will not require any form of input from the controller.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>However, the solution dispenser will require a periodic signal from the controller every few seconds. When the controller signals the spray nozzle, a small amount of cleaning solution will be sprayed onto the window surface.</p>

                    <p>The controller (an Arduino Mega) can be seen as the core component in our robot. It receives information from sensors on the robot, such as the current adhesive grip on the window surface and if the robot has reached some form of obstacle. Based on the information and signals received, the controller then sends signals to the motors and the electric ducted fan (EDF) in order to control the movement and suction force of the robot on the window surface.</p>

                <dd class="accordion-content">A microcontroller is required to interface with the motors, sensors and cleaning mechanism. Given analog inputs and outputs required by motors and sensors, we have selected two primary options – Arduino Mega and TI MSP430 LaunchPad. Some advantages of Arduino Mega include a massive online community support and libraries which would accelerate our robot’s development. Furthermore, the Arduino Mega has a lot more I/O pins as compared to TI MSP430 which can be helpful given the number of sensors and motors we are using.<br/><br/>However, the TI MSP430 is much cheaper and has more flexible PWM controls as it uses a 16 bit timer rather than ATMega328P’s 8 bit timer. Furthermore, the TI MSP430 has a low power draw features which allow us to consider the possibility of battery-supported operation.<br/><br/>Given the complexity of our prototyping and possibly high I/O pins requirement, we have selected Arduino Mega as our microcontroller.</dd>

Accuracy refers to the sensor’s ability to detect the window boundary; a sensor’s range is evaluated based on its maximum and minimum operational range; the ease of implementation is dependent on the ease of processing the information a sensor returns.<br/><br/>By requiring direct physical contact with an object to trigger a tactile sensor’s response, a tactile sensor is deemed to be more accurate than a proximity sensor. The increased accuracy allows for more precise movement at the boundaries of the window. However, a proximity sensor has greater range than tactile sensor and provides additional information (such as the distance between the edge and the sensor). This helps us in fine-tuning movements near the boundaries<br/><br/>Visual sensors have the advantage of increased range as well as an additional capability of differentiating between a window edge and unexpected obstacles. However, the implementation of visual sensor is more complicated than tactile and proximity sensors, severely discounting its effectiveness and efficiency.<br/><br/>Based on the comparison, we chose to utilize tactile and proximity sensors for our robot.</dd>

                <dd class="accordion-content">To meet the project’s requirement of cleaning the window completely, there are several methods the robot can utilize. Such methods include a more thorough method, as well as a “search-and-clean” path-finding algorithm.<br/><br/>For the first and more thorough method, the robot will run through the entire window, cleaning every point regardless of the current cleanliness. On the other hand, another algorithm the robot can employ would be searching the window for dirty spots before cleaning it. The primary criteria used to evaluate these options would be the time required for the robot to complete its task. As the project requires the robot to clean at least 10 ft2 per minute, we chose the first method. This ensures the robot is able to consistently cover the entire span of the window within a certain amount of time over several runs.<br/><br/>In comparison, the search-and-clean methods require the robot to detect dirty spots before cleaning up the window. To accomplish that, the robot will still have to run through the entire window at least once. Hence, the search-and-clean method is deemed to be slower as the robot have to take on the extra task of analyzing the window for dirt.</dd>

                <dt><span class="accordion-status"></span><span>Grip</span></dt>
                <dd class="accordion-content">Several methods of generating grip to the window were investigated and analyzed for their advantages and disadvantages with regard to the objective task. Possible adhesion sources include the use of gecko adhesive pads, suction cups, vacuum fan suction, and magnets.<br/><br/>Gecko adhesives pads are a biologically inspired synthetic adhesive that creates adhesion via van der Waals intermolecular forces. Gecko adhesives are advantageous because of their property of being directionally controllable. However, the disadvantages of gecko pads in terrestrial applications outweigh the advantages because the max shear, normal, and moment loads are an order of magnitude smaller than that of suction cups.<br/><br/>Suction cups are a more appealing alternative for gecko pads because they are also fairly easy to actuate and toggle between ON and OFF states whilst offering significantly more adhesive strength. However, suction cups can create a suction that requires significant pull-off force to disengage. This is highly undesirable for a climbing robot where a large pull-off force could destabilize the robot, causing the entire robot to fall off on the window.<br/><br/>An electric ducted vacuum fan (EDF) offers similar advantages to suction cups, such as high adhesive strength and ease of actuation.A vacuum fan offers the potential to be much faster than a robot that employs suction cups. A robot with EDF can use a much simpler wheeled locomotion strategy while the fan runs continuously to create a constant normal force into the window plane for ‘grip’. However, the EDF is unable to generate as much suction force as a static sealed suction cup can. Hence, a disadvantage of this method is that the robot will have to be very light weight.<br/><br/>The final option considered was the use of magnets to create adhesion to the climbing surface. There have been previous climbing robots that make use of electro magnets to climb. However, this constrains the robot’s climbing surfaces to strictly ferromagnetic materials (glass is not a ferromagnetic material). Alternative methods employing magnetic forces would require magnets on both sides of the window which would introduce further complexity and reduce real-world practicality of operation.<br/><br/>Thus, with all things considered, it was decided that the EDF vacuum fan would be used as the source of creating grip.</dd>

                <dt><span class="accordion-status"></span><span>Movement</span></dt>
                <dd class="accordion-content">There are two main options to enable the robot to move about the window – a wheeled chassis or by suction caps.<br/><br/>The chassis consists of 4 wheels each driven by independent small brushed DC gear motors. The 4 independent motors will enable torque vectoring to drive forward, backward, and turn in place. Alternatively, treads could be used to generate a larger contact area between the robot and the climbing surface for better steering control. The trade-off for treads would be increased weight in the drive mechanism. Thus, treads are not ideal for an application where weight is a critical factor.<br/><br/>If the suction cup grip method was chosen, then 4 suction cups could be used in a ‘+’ configuration where at least two suction cups will always be engaged to the wall surface at all times. The pairs of suction cups adhered to the wall will alternate and the pair of suction cups not adhered will be slid up, down, left, or right relative to the adhered pair using two rack and pinion mechanisms.<br/><br/>With the use of the EDF vacuum grip method, the locomotion method can be simplified to a basic wheeled chassis. A wheeled chassis complements the choice of EDF as the main adhesion method, and enables the robot to have better mobility around the window.</dd>

                <dt><span class="accordion-status"></span><span>Cleaning</span></dt>
                <dd class="accordion-content">There are two components to the cleaning subsystem. The cleaning subsystem requires a method to dispense cleaning solution onto the window. Without the cleaning solution, the robot might find it tough to remove certain stains and marks. On the other hand, there are also two different ways our robot can dispense the solution: continuous- or timed-release of solution. Our team decided to choose the latter method, as it allows the robot to minimize the usage of cleaning solution. Hence, this method reduce the amount of solution to be kept on the robot, and consequently reduces the weight as well.<br/><br/>Our team have also narrowed down the method of cleaning to three choices – bristle brushes, spiraling multi-brush, and a passive squeegee. A passive squeegee would be the easiest to install, but the resulting cleanliness leaves much to be desired. Hence, the squeegee is ranked the worst of the three methods. Between bristle brushes and spiraling multi-brushes, the level of cleanliness is deemed to be comparable. However, the spiraling multi-brushes are harder to actuate as compared to bristle brushes. Hence, our team decided that our robot will employ the bristle brush as the main cleaning method.</dd>

                    <p>All the sub-systems have been successfully integrated together. There are three main aspects to the system integration.</p>
                    <p>1) With the IMU's input, we are able to calculate the robot's orientation. Once the IMU senses that the robot is placed in the vertical position, the EDF will be activated to adhere the robot to the window.</p>
                    <p>2) The path-finding involves making a U-turn at the window boundary. Each turn is controlled by a combination of IR sensor, IMU and encoders. Figure 7 shows the transition between turning states in path-finding algorithm.</p>

                    <p>3) To compensate for the off-course error, the robot utilizes IMU for greater accuracy. The basic PID loop was altered to incorporate the pitch angle and self-correct its steering to counteract the random drift that occurs during movement. Note that since the robot is moving straight only in the east and west direction during path-finding, the motor feedback is isolated to these directions.

                    <p>The updated chassis concept uses two smaller EDF fans placed and centered at the front and back of the chassis. Two smaller EDFs are used because it was determined that a single smaller fan could not produce enough thrust to achieve reliable and robust grip throughout all driving maneuvers on the window.</p>
                    <p><br/>The video below demonstrates how a prototype v2 of our robot with a single EDF is able to cling onto a surface.<br/><br/></p>

                    <h4 class="header-divider">Grip</h4>
                    <p>The original 4-wheeled drive was reduced to a differential 2-wheel drive. Both wheels are centered on the chassis and the passive cleaning structure on the front and back of the robot serve to balance the robot from pitching about its central drive axle. The decision to use a centered two wheel differential drive versus the 4-wheel differential was based upon the initial test results with the 4-wheel system. During 4-wheel drive tests the robot had trouble with grip because the system was much larger and heavier. In addition, the main acrylic chassis base was slightly warping or deflecting under the load of the EDF thrust and wasn’t evenly distributed among the wheels leading to slip in some wheels. This slip introduced significant drifting problems and also posed challenges when attempting to turn accurately in place. Therefore, by reducing the the number of wheels from 4 to 2, the system was able to be reduced in mass significantly and turning became more robust and was able to be executed more rapidly and in a repeatable manner. Figure 9 below shows a prototype of the window cleaning robot, with its two distinct wheel system.</p>

                    <h4 class="header-divider">Localization</h4>
                    <p>The adhesive force acting on the window will primarily be controlled by a PID controller. The feedback signals will be provided by 2 main components: a force-sensitive resistor (FSR) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU).<br/><br/>The IMU provides extremely accurate readings of the sensor’s current position. For instance, the IMU generates readings such as its roll, pitch, and its bearings. With the different results, we will be able to figure out if the EDF is providing sufficient adhesive force. The figures below shows a possible position of the IMU (Figure 10, left), as well as a computer visualization of its position (Figure 10, right).</p>

                    <p><br/><br/>To finetune RACER’s movement, the robot also employed the use of Pololu’s optical encoders. By attaching the encoders onto wheels, the controller is now able to:<br/>1)Specify a certain amount of rotation to be done by the wheel(s)<br/>2) Detect the amount of rotation experienced by the wheel<br/><br/>With both functionalities, the encoders then serve to complement the IMU in detecting its location, orientation, and distance travelled.
                    <h4 class="header-divider">Boundary detection</h4>
                    <p>The boundary detection will be achieved using both an infrared sensor (IR sensor) as well as a tactile sensor. <br/></br>The IR sensor is used to detect the any obstacles in the direction facing the IR sensor. The sensor transmit the data to the microcontroller through variations of voltages, and the microcontroller will have to decipher the corresponding distance of the obstacle. Figure 11 below shows linearization equation used to calculate the real-life distance of the obstacle from a voltage reading.</p>

                <div id="tabs-si-4" class="tab-si_container">
                    <p>The cleaning subsystem will consist of 2 main mechanisms – dispensing of cleaning solution and the cloth extension.<br/><br/>The robot will periodically dispense cleaning solution via a pump and nozzle onto the window. The cleaning solution was decided to be dispensed periodically to save on solution (and hence reduce the weight RACER is supposed to carry), as well as to ensure a relatively dry environment for RACER to work in. The video below shows the motor pump dispensing solution using a plastic tube. A microcontroller will be used to send a periodic signal to activate the pump (not shown in the video).<br/><br/></p>
                    <p class="imgtext"><br/><img src="images/cleaning/pump_control_v2.png" alt=""/><br>Figure 12: Pump Control Mechanism</p>
                    <p><br/>In addition, this system consists of two cleaning plates that extend below the robot and make contact with the window. These extensions are identical in design, with one at the front of the chassis and the other at the rear. The first extension will complete the majority of the cleaning, and spreading the cleaning solution across the width of the robot. The second extension mechanism will remove any excess fluid and dirt that the first leaves behind. These mechanisms are a thin piece of acrylic with industrial strength Velcro on the top side. The cleaning cloth is doubled up, and wrapped around the acrylic and attaches to the Velcro.</p>

                    <p>RACER will be controller via one microcontroller – the Arduino Mega. Figure 14 below shows a picture of the Arduino Mega.</p>
                    <p class="imgtext"><br/><img src="images/system_implementation/8.jpg" alt=""/><br>Figure 14: Picture of Arduino Mega</p>
                    <p><br/>The microcontroller will implement a pathfinding algorithm to allow the robot to clean the entire window. Currently, the microcontroller is able to implement a naïve method of cleaning the window by controlling RACER to zig-zag across the window from a corner to another corner. Figure 15 below shows the initial route RACER will take to clean the window, starting from the bottom left corner.<br/><br/></p>
                    <p class="imgtext"><br/><img src="images/system_implementation/old_pathfinding.jpg" alt=""/><br>Figure 15: Old Implementation of a Pathfinding Algorithm</p>
                    <p><br/>However, after extensive testing, our team came to the conclusion that the above pathfinding algorithm is not ideal. This is due to the wheels slipping whilst climbing upwards, leading to inaccurate readings from the encoders. Hence, we decided to change the starting position of RACER, as well as change the direction it will move. However, as seen in Figure 16 below, the “lawnmower” motion of RACER is kept the same.<br/><br/></p>
                    <p class="imgtext"><br/><img src="images/system_implementation/new_pathfinding.jpg" alt=""/><br>Figure 16: New Implementation of a Pathfinding Algorithm</p>
                    <p><br/>As discussed in the sensors section, we are utilizing encoders as a complement to the IMU to localize RACER. However, one drawback of using encoders will be the need to continuously poll the encoders for data. This could lead to RACER taking an infinite amount of time waiting on the encoders. To avoid this issue, we attached the encoders to Arduino’s in-built interrupt call. Hence, Arduino will raise an interrupt every instance when the encoders have information to convey to the controller.</p>
                    <p><br/>To prevent errors due to wiring disconnections. we have created the circuit schematic and designed a PCB board. Regarding the circuit, the arduino and motor drivers are powered via an external power supply. The rest of the components are powered via the 5V output from the arduino. The motors and EDF are also required to be connected to the PWM pins. We have added in switches and push buttons to as external controls for the various functionalities of the robot. Figure 17 displays the circuit diagram for all the electrical components.<br/><br/></p>
                    <p class="imgtext"><br/><img src="images/system_implementation/RACER_circuit.png" alt=""/><br>Figure 17: RACER Circuit Diagram</p>
                    <p><br/>Due to the space constraint from adding a second EDF to the chassis, there was insufficient space to put a breadboard or circuit board on the chassis. Hence, we came up with the idea to mount a circuit board on top of the Arduino, creating an additional layer on top of the Arduino while providing space for RACER’s circuitry. Figure 18 below displays the proposed method of mounting the solder-able circuit board on top of the Arduino.<br/><br/></p>

                    <p><br/>As shown in Figure 18 above, we would solder extension pins onto the circuit board before attaching the entire board to the Arduino. RACER’s circuitry will then be soldered onto the circuit board. Hence, by mounting the circuit in such a way, we are able to save space on the chassis while ensuring the integrity and stability of the circuit. Figure 19 shows the PCB circuitry design.<br/><br/></p>

                    <p><br/><b>Wheel Control:</b> By polling the number of interrupts raised by the Arduino, we managed to achieve a resolution of approximately 800 ticks per revolution done by the wheel and encoder combination. This translates to approximately 2.22 ticks per degree change. Hence, we are able to achieve control of 0.5 degree change for the wheels via the Arduino.</p>
                    <p><br/><b>Interrupts:</b> To increase robustness, our wheel encoders utilizes interrupts rather than a continuous polling system call. By using interrupts, we ensure that the main control loop does not get stuck in the polling state, but is continuously running.</p>
