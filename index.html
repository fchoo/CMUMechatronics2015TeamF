                <h1>Problem Description</h1>
                <span class="border"></span>
                <p>In 2011, 8 workers in the United States sustained fatal injuries whilst cleaning the exterior of buildings. These cleaners suspend themselves midair and work with soapy water, putting themselves at a high risk of falling. Hence, this project serves to minimize the number of injuries and fatalities of window cleaning by automating the process, eliminating the need for workers to put themselves at risk.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Aptly named <em>RACER</em>, this robot is fully automated. By placing the robot in a predefined location on the window, it will automatically sense the dimensions of the window and perform the cleaning without any human inputs. In addition, our robot aims to be faster than other available robotic window cleaners out in the commercial market.</p>

                <span class="border"></span>
                <h3>Explicit Design Requirements</h3><br/>
                <p>From the project specifications, there are several explicit requirements the robot has to meet. With regards to performance, the robot should fully clean one side of a window automatically, where the window size can range from 3' x 4' to 5' x 6'. More specifically, the robot must clean the entire surface of the window at a speed of at least 10 ft2 per min. In terms of cleanliness, the window will be visibly clean from a distance of 3 feet away with no streaks, moisture or residue left on the window after 30 seconds of completion. The robot should also be able to clean both glass and acrylic plastics without scratching or damaging the window surface.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>The robot's physical structure should fit within a 2 ft2 footprint. However, the robot can have retractable parts and a variable aspect ratio as long as the robot maintains the aforementioned 2 ft2 footprint. The cleaning devices should not cross the vertical plane of the window - this space would generally not be available due to protrusions around the window border. Cleaning supplies should also be contained within the robot. There should not be any infrastructure installed external to the robot with the exception of tethers connecting it to an external compressor and/or power. In addition, the robot should not be operated from the ground.</p>
                <br/><br/>
                <h3>Derived and Additional "Coolness" Factors</h3><br/>
                <p>Additional factors are included into our robot to stand out from the designs from other teams. We have chosen to increase the speed of the robot by 50% (cleaning at least 15 ft2 per min) while maintaining the high cleanliness standards required. Also, the robot is also designed to minimize the use of cleaning supplies (water and cleaning solution) in order to reduce its weight.</p>

                <p>From the design requirements, our team derived four main functions the robot must have – movement, suction, environment-sensing and cleaning. Figure 2 depicts the major functions and flows between the functions.</p>

                <p>The sensors will be in-charged of providing the environmental information (such as cleanliness of window and position of the robot) to the controller. With the information, the controller then further instructs the locomotion subsystem. Figure 2 shows the logic flow of the robot's movement. In the meantime, the controller will separately instruct the cleaning component(s).</p>

                <p>The following architecture describes the flow of information between the different subsystems within our robot. As described previously, the following four main subsystems in the robot’s physical architecture (main controller, sensors, cleaning, and locomotion) are depicted in Figure 3 below. The supply of power will be distributed by the main controller (an Arduino Mega) to the other subsystems.</p>

                    <h4>Sensor</h4>
                    <p>The sensors component exists to interpret information from the current environment as well as the orientation of the robot. In this subsystem, there are two main components - grip sensors and boundary detection sensors. The grip sensors consist of force-sensitive resistors at the wheels and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to sense the displacement off the window surface and the direction that the robot is facing with respect to gravity. The controller will make use of this information to calculate the required gripping force. The boundary detection component serves as the "eyes" of the robot. The tactile and IR sensors will provide feedback on the immediate surroundings of the robot, such as the distance to the nearest window boundary or obstacle.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="one_half last">
                <div class="service-item text-left element_from_right">
                    <h4>Locomotion</h4>
                    <p>The locomotion subsystem consists of the robot’s movement and the adhesive grip on the window surface. Based on the information (direction, speed of travel, and fan speed) the controller subsystem provides, the locomotion subsystem carries out the movement direction by the controller. Our robot’s ability to move will be enabled by four independent wheels driven by motors. With independent movement for each of the wheels, the robot will have the additional flexibility to turn in place.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Our robot will employ an electric ducted fan as the adhesive component. The EDF creates a constant vacuum force onto the window, hence allowing the robot to be held in place on the window. An advantage of using the EDF would include the ability to manipulate the fan speed (and hence, the adhesive force) based on feedback from the sensors (FSR and IMU).</p>

                <div class="service-item text-right element_from_left">
                    <h4>Cleaning</h4>
                    <p>The cleaning subsystem has two main mechanisms – scrubbing and solution dispensing. The bristle brushes will be continuously running as long as the robot is functioning. Hence, the scrubbing component will not require any form of input from the controller.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>However, the solution dispenser will require a periodic signal from the controller every few seconds. When the controller signals the spray nozzle, a small amount of cleaning solution will be sprayed onto the window surface.</p>

                    <h4>Controller</h4>
                    <p>The controller (an Arduino Uno) can be seen as the core component in our robot. It receives information from sensors on the robot, such as the current adhesive grip on the window surface and if the robot has reached some form of obstacle. Based on the information and signals received, the controller then sends signals to the motors and the electric ducted fan (EDF) in order to control the movement and suction force of the robot on the window surface.</p>

                    <p>The chassis is made of laser acrylic and wood and measures 15" by 15". The robot is held normal to the wall with the use of a 5" electric duct fan.</p>

                    <h5>Controller</h5>
                    <p>The main controller used will be an Arduino Mega. It has several features, such as 54 digital I/O and 16 analog I/O channels, 256 KB of storage, and 8KB of RAM.</p>

                    <p>The cleaning system on the robot uses 4 high speed cylindrically spiraled bristle brushes and buffers. Each high speed brush is coupled to a drive motor so that no additional actuators are necessary to power the brushes. This design reduces weight considerably and also offers a mechanical fix that automatically adjusts the speed of the rotating bristles proportionally to the speed of the robot.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>The robot will have a small onboard tank to carry the cleaning solution and will have 2 to 4 spray nozzles to disperse the cleaning solution on the window.</p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>To allow for more precise maneuver near the boundaries, we are also using Sharp GP2Y0D815Z0F Digital Distance Sensor 15cm with a range of 0.5-15cm. This proximity sensor provides us with distance measurement of the boundaries with good precision.</p>
                </li>

                    <p>For the grip sub-system, we are using Popolu MinIMU-9 v3 to measure and calculate the orientation of the robot. With nine independent rotation, acceleration, we can use the provided Arduino library to calculate estimated roll, pitch, and yaw angles, and visualize orientation of the board with the 3D test program.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>To ensure the gripping force stay within the allowance range, we are using two 1.5 inch Force Sensing Resistors (FSR) to measure the pressure of the chassis on the axles of the wheels. The readings from the FSRs provide a good enough approximation to check the stability of the gripping force.</p>

                <dd class="accordion-content">A microcontroller is required to interface with the motors, sensors and cleaning mechanism. Given analog inputs and outputs required by motors and sensors, we have selected two primary options – Arduino Mega and TI MSP430 LaunchPad. Some advantages of Arduino Mega include a massive online community support and libraries which would accelerate our robot’s development. Furthermore, the Arduino Mega has a lot more I/O pins as compared to TI MSP430 which can be helpful given the number of sensors and motors we are using.<br/><br/>However, the TI MSP430 is much cheaper and has more flexible PWM controls as it uses a 16 bit timer rather than ATMega328P’s 8 bit timer. Furthermore, the TI MSP430 has a low power draw features which allow us to consider the possibility of battery-supported operation.<br/><br/>Given the complexity of our prototyping and possibly high I/O pins requirement, we have selected Arduino Mega as our microcontroller.</dd>

                <dt><span class="accordion-status"></span><span>Boundary Detection</span></dt>
                <dd class="accordion-content">There are primarily three types of sensors – tactile, proximity and visual – that fulfill the function of detecting a window edge. We evaluated these sensors based on three criteria: accuracy, range and ease of implementation. Accuracy refers to the sensor’s ability to detect the window boundary; a sensor’s range is evaluated based on its maximum and minimum operational range; the ease of implementation is dependent on the ease of processing the information a sensor returns.<br/><br/>By requiring direct physical contact with an object to trigger a tactile sensor’s response, a tactile sensor is deemed to be more accurate than a proximity sensor. The increased accuracy allows for more precise movement at the boundaries of the window. However, a proximity sensor has greater range than tactile sensor and provides additional information (such as the distance between the edge and the sensor). This helps us in fine-tuning movements near the boundaries<br/><br/>Visual sensors have the advantage of increased range as well as an additional capability of differentiating between a window edge and unexpected obstacles. However, the implementation of visual sensor is more complicated than tactile and proximity sensors, severely discounting its effectiveness and efficiency.<br/><br/>Based on the comparison, we chose to utilize tactile and proximity sensors for our robot.</dd>

                <dd class="accordion-content">To meet the project’s requirement of cleaning the window completely, there are several methods the robot can utilize. Such methods include a more thorough method, as well as a “search-and-clean” path-finding algorithm.<br/><br/>For the first and more thorough method, the robot will run through the entire window, cleaning every point regardless of the current cleanliness. On the other hand, another algorithm the robot can employ would be searching the window for dirty spots before cleaning it. The primary criteria used to evaluate these options would be the time required for the robot to complete its task. As the project requires the robot to clean at least 10 ft2 per minute, we chose the first method. This ensures the robot is able to consistently cover the entire span of the window within a certain amount of time over several runs.<br/><br/>In comparison, the search-and-clean methods require the robot to detect dirty spots before cleaning up the window. To accomplish that, the robot will still have to run through the entire window at least once. Hence, the search-and-clean method is deemed to be slower as the robot have to take on the extra task of analyzing the window for dirt.</dd>

                <dt><span class="accordion-status"></span><span>Grip</span></dt>
                <dd class="accordion-content">Several methods of generating grip to the window were investigated and analyzed for their advantages and disadvantages with regard to the objective task. Possible adhesion sources include the use of gecko adhesive pads, suction cups, vacuum fan suction, and magnets.<br/><br/>Gecko adhesives pads are a biologically inspired synthetic adhesive that creates adhesion via van der Waals intermolecular forces. Gecko adhesives are advantageous because of their property of being directionally controllable. However, the disadvantages of gecko pads in terrestrial applications outweigh the advantages because the max shear, normal, and moment loads are an order of magnitude smaller than that of suction cups.<br/><br/>Suction cups are a more appealing alternative for gecko pads because they are also fairly easy to actuate and toggle between ON and OFF states whilst offering significantly more adhesive strength. However, suction cups can create a suction that requires significant pull-off force to disengage. This is highly undesirable for a climbing robot where a large pull-off force could destabilize the robot, causing the entire robot to fall off on the window.<br/><br/>An electric ducted vacuum fan (EDF) offers similar advantages to suction cups, such as high adhesive strength and ease of actuation.A vacuum fan offers the potential to be much faster than a robot that employs suction cups. A robot with EDF can use a much simpler wheeled locomotion strategy while the fan runs continuously to create a constant normal force into the window plane for ‘grip’. However, the EDF is unable to generate as much suction force as a static sealed suction cup can. Hence, a disadvantage of this method is that the robot will have to be very light weight.<br/><br/>The final option considered was the use of magnets to create adhesion to the climbing surface. There have been previous climbing robots that make use of electro magnets to climb. However, this constrains the robot’s climbing surfaces to strictly ferromagnetic materials (glass is not a ferromagnetic material). Alternative methods employing magnetic forces would require magnets on both sides of the window which would introduce further complexity and reduce real-world practicality of operation.<br/><br/>Thus, with all things considered, it was decided that the EDF vacuum fan would be used as the source of creating grip.</dd>

                <dt><span class="accordion-status"></span><span>Movement</span></dt>
                <dd class="accordion-content">There are two main options to enable the robot to move about the window – a wheeled chassis or by suction caps.<br/><br/>The chassis consists of 4 wheels each driven by independent small brushed DC gear motors. The 4 independent motors will enable torque vectoring to drive forward, backward, and turn in place. Alternatively, treads could be used to generate a larger contact area between the robot and the climbing surface for better steering control. The trade-off for treads would be increased weight in the drive mechanism. Thus, treads are not ideal for an application where weight is a critical factor.<br/><br/>If the suction cup grip method was chosen, then 4 suction cups could be used in a ‘+’ configuration where at least two suction cups will always be engaged to the wall surface at all times. The pairs of suction cups adhered to the wall will alternate and the pair of suction cups not adhered will be slid up, down, left, or right relative to the adhered pair using two rack and pinion mechanisms.<br/><br/>With the use of the EDF vacuum grip method, the locomotion method can be simplified to a basic wheeled chassis. A wheeled chassis complements the choice of EDF as the main adhesion method, and enables the robot to have better mobility around the window.</dd>

                <dt><span class="accordion-status"></span><span>Cleaning</span></dt>
                <dd class="accordion-content">There are two components to the cleaning subsystem. The cleaning subsystem requires a method to dispense cleaning solution onto the window. Without the cleaning solution, the robot might find it tough to remove certain stains and marks. On the other hand, there are also two different ways our robot can dispense the solution: continuous- or timed-release of solution. Our team decided to choose the latter method, as it allows the robot to minimize the usage of cleaning solution. Hence, this method reduce the amount of solution to be kept on the robot, and consequently reduces the weight as well.<br/><br/>Our team have also narrowed down the method of cleaning to three choices – bristle brushes, spiraling multi-brush, and a passive squeegee. A passive squeegee would be the easiest to install, but the resulting cleanliness leaves much to be desired. Hence, the squeegee is ranked the worst of the three methods. Between bristle brushes and spiraling multi-brushes, the level of cleanliness is deemed to be comparable. However, the spiraling multi-brushes are harder to actuate as compared to bristle brushes. Hence, our team decided that our robot will employ the bristle brush as the main cleaning method.</dd>

                    <p>All the sub-systems have been successfully integrated together. There are three main aspects to the system integration.</p>
                    <p>1) With the IMU's input, we are able to calculate the robot's orientation. Once the IMU senses that the robot is placed in the vertical position, the EDF will be activated to adhere the robot to the window.</p>
                    <p>2) The path-finding involves making a U-turn at the window boundary. Each turn is controlled by a combination of IR sensor, IMU and encoders. Figure 5 shows the transition between turning states in path-finding algorithm.</p>
                    <p class="imgtext"><br/><img src="images/system_implementation/STD_sensors.jpg" alt=""/><br>Figure 5: Path-finding State Transition Logic with Sensors</p>
                    <p>3) To compensate for the off-course error, the robot utilizes IMU for greater accuracy. The basic PID loop was altered to incorporate the pitch angle and self-correct its steering to counteract the random drift that occurs during movement. Note that since the robot is moving straight only in the east and west direction during path-finding, the motor feedback is isolated to these directions.

                    <h4 class="header-divider">Movement</h4>
                    <p>The robot’s movement will be enabled by four independent DC motors and wheel system. The wheels have independent motion so as to allow the robot to turn in place. More specifically, the robot will have the capability to turn 90° right or left, depending on its current position. Figure 7 below shows a prototype of the window cleaning robot, with its four distinct wheel system.</p>

                    <h4 class="header-divider">Grip</h4>
                    <p>The robot will be held in place via the electric duct fan (EDF). The EDF will create a normal suction force toward the window, while the wheels will provide the friction for the robot to maintain its position. In Figure 7 above, the EDF is placed at the centre of the chassis, supported by a wooden frame. The wooden frame’s purpose is to evenly distribute the force generated by the EDF to the four different wheels.</p>
                    <p><br/>The video below demonstrates how a prototype of our robot is able to cling onto a surface. The robot in the video has a substantially smaller fan, but its chassis is also smaller.<br/><br/></p>

                    <p>The adhesive force acting on the window will primarily be controlled by a PID controller. The feedback signals will be provided by 2 main components: a force-sensitive resistor (FSR) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU).<br/><br/>The IMU provides extremely accurate readings of the sensor’s current position. For instance, the IMU generates readings such as its roll, pitch, and its bearings. With the different results, we will be able to figure out if the EDF is providing sufficient adhesive force. Figure 8 below shows a possible position of the IMU (Figure 8, left), as well as a computer visualization of its position (Figure 8, right).</p>
                    <p class="imgtext"><br/><img src="images/system_implementation/4.png" alt=""/><br>Figure 8: Real-life position of an IMU sensor (left); Computer Generated Position of the IMU sensor (right)</p>
                    <p><br/>The FSR will be a second sensor we would use to determine the adhesive force applied by the EDF. FSRs will be placed between the chassis and the motor. In sensors lab, we managed to calibrate and utlize the FSR to output minute variations of force applied on the FSR. Figure 9 below shows a screenshot of the different values it received. </p>
                    <p class="imgtext"><br/><img src="images/system_implementation/5.png" alt=""/><br>Figure 9: Screenshot of FSR’s reading</p>
                    <p><br/>In addition, the extra grip sensor serves to fulfill reliability engineering’s notion of dual modular redundancy, as the IMU and FSR will provide independent readings of the adhesive force.</p>
                    <h4 class="header-divider">Boundary detection</h4>
                    <p>The boundary detection will be achieved using both an infrared sensor (IR sensor) as well as a tactile sensor. <br/></br>The IR sensor is used to detect the any obstacles in the direction facing the IR sensor. The sensor transmit the data to the microcontroller through variations of voltages, and the microcontroller will have to decipher the corresponding distance of the obstacle. Figure 10 below shows linearization equation used to calculate the real-life distance of the obstacle from a voltage reading.</p>

                    <p><br/>The tactile sensor will be mounted at the front of the chassis, and will primarily be used as a form of switch. When the robot hits an obstacle or a boundary, the tactile sensor will be triggered and alert the microcontroller of the existence of the obstacle or boundary. This is also an implementation of dual modular redundancy.</p>

                    <p>The cleaning subsystem will consist of 2 main mechanisms – dispensing of cleaning solution and the scrubbing mechanism.<br/><br/>The robot will periodically dispense cleaning solution via a pump and nozzle onto the window. The cleaning solution was decided to be dispensed periodically to save on solution (and hence reduce the weight RACER is supposed to carry), as well as to ensure a relatively dry environment for RACER to work in. The video below shows the motor pump dispensing solution using a plastic tube. A microcontroller will be used to send a periodic signal to activate the pump (not shown in the video).<br/><br/></p>

                    </div>
                    <p>In addition, RACER will have an inbuilt scrubbing mechanism (consisting of four bristle brushes attached to each of the four motors). Figure 11 below shows a CAD model of the scrubbing mechanism to be attached to the wheels.</p>

Currently, the microcontroller is able to implement a naïve method of cleaning the window by controlling RACER to zig-zag across the window from a corner to another corner. Figure 13 below shows the route RACER will take with the above implementation of the pathfinding algorithm.<br/><br/></p>

However, that does not affect our system as the maximum distance reading required is 30cm.<br/><br/>In addition, from another systems test, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) is able to calculate and transmit orientation and bearings up to 0.01° accuracy.
