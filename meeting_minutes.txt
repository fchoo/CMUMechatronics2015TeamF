Wed Presentation
1) IMU
2) EDF
3) Spray pump working
4) Final design
5) Path Finding

Future Goals
1) Pair IMU with EDF
2) Pair Path finding with IMU
3) Moving mounted chassis with EDF

Notes/Recommendations
1) Total Weight < 3kg
2) PCB: Advanced circuit - 33 bucks + <20 shipping
	Have their own software to design the circuit
3) Obstacles: can place our own obstacles

----------------------

Progress Update:
1) Better wheels surface
	- careful of how the wheels surface will take on the dirt

Wed Presentation
1) Pathfinding + IMU
2) IMU + EDF
3) EDF Skirt Mounted
4) PID

Future Goal
1) Robot moving on flat ground
2) Robot moving on inclined surface
3) Cleaning system design finalization
4) Navigation integrated

-----------------------------

3/16/2015
Progress Update:
1) Faced some troubles with wheel controls
2) Finalization of cleaning mechanism design

Wed Presentation:
1) Precise wheel controls
2) Straight travel on vertical surface

Future Goals:
1) Pathfinding/Navex on the floor
2) Cleaning mechanism mounted
3) Start on circuit schematic
4) Finalize CAD model with circuitries
5) Turning on window
6) Coverage on window if possible

Idea
1) Sensors to detect distance from floor

-----------------------------------

3/23/2015
Progress Update:
1) New chassis redesign
2) Cleaning mechanism mounted

Wed Presentation
1) Pathfinding on floor
2) Passive cleaning mechanism mounted
3) Manual control movements on window

Idea
1) Control the speed via joystick

----------------------------------------

3/30/2015
Progress Update:
1) EDF destroyed

Wed Presentation
1) Pump spraying in precise model
2) CAD model of two EDF
3) Risk Management plan: how to recover from EDF explosion

Future Goals
1) Pathfinding on window
2) Slip detection correction
3) New chassis with edf
4) Cleaning pump integrated

TODO:
1) Website Update (Apr 3, midnight)
2) Button to start the pathfinding
2) Indication to show pathfinding is done
